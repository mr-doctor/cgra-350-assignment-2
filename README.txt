I completed Core with hierarchical modelling and posed the skeleton with the required dimensions and object primitives. This is demonstrated when the Checkbox
in the ImGui screen is checked.

I was unable to fully complete Completion using the axis arrows and required primitives, but I was able to implement posing and correctly show hierarchical modelling
with rotations and translations. The three different poses can be cycled through by clicking the "Cycle Poses" ImGui button. This will demonstrate the 
posing. The poses are Walking, Sitting, and Ballet Dancing.

I did not attempt Challenge.

The project requires all of the resource files to be in the same directories that they have been submitted in. a1.exe must be created and run to demonstrate the project.
